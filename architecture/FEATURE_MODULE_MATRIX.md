The canonical machine-readable definitions are in `src/app-profile.js`, `src/module-registry.js`, `src/content-pack-registry.js`, `src/sync-storage-profile.js`, and `src/app-forge-blueprint.js`.

## Build 0.97.0 AppForge Product Blueprint

`core.appForgeBlueprint` is now a registered core module. App Profile schema 9 marks the complete product definition as blueprint-enabled, while `src/app-forge-blueprint.js` validates module dependencies and every configured record, workflow, content, branding, and storage reference. FireVault can export those contracts together as one portable AppForge build input without changing its local-first vault or technician workflow.
